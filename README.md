# Duolingo Magic Carpet Campaign Website

A digital marketing campaign website for Duolingo's "Magic Carpet Experience" - an innovative feature designed to make language learning more engaging for children ages 6-10. This campaign is a student project for Bournemouth University's Digital Marketing module.

## Project Overview

The "Fly into Language Learning" campaign positions Duolingo's Magic Carpet as a transformative experience that makes language learning feel like a magical adventure. The website showcases how children can customize their own magic carpets that evolve and transform as they learn.

Key features of the campaign:
- Personalized learning journeys based on learning styles
- Gamification elements that add magical effects to carpets
- Premium features that enhance the learning experience

## Campaign Strategy

The campaign adopts the "Magic Carpet Journey" creative concept, targeting parents of children ages 6-10 with messaging around the neuroplasticity advantage that children have for language learning.

The RACE framework guides our approach:
- **Reach**: Engaging visuals and messaging about 45% faster learning for children
- **Act**: Interactive Magic Carpet Experience customizer 
- **Convert**: Free 14-day trial of Super Duolingo premium features
- **Engage**: Personalized learning journeys and shareable achievements
